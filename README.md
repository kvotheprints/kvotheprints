Other Projects

This section highlights some of my other projects, ranging from web applications to command-line tools. Each project has its own dedicated repository with a more detailed description.
Thesus: Custom Ender 3 Pro

*   **Description:** This project is a heavily modified Ender 3 Pro 3D printer, which I've nicknamed "Thesus." I've re-engineered the hardware and software to improve its performance and reliability, turning it into a truly custom machine.
*   **Modifications:**
    *   **Structural:** Raised the printer's base to move the motherboard, power supply, and server below the print bed, creating a more compact and stable unit.
    *   **Hotend & Extruder:** Installed a custom hotend and a 3D-printed extruder with a new stepper motor, configured as a direct drive using a custom bracket.
    *   **Leveling:** Integrated an Enderklack probe for precise bed leveling.
*   **Software & Technology:**
    *   The printer is powered by Klipper, a high-performance firmware, with Mainsail as the web interface for control and monitoring.
    *   I use GitHub to back up all my Klipper configuration files, ensuring my settings are always secure and version-controlled.
