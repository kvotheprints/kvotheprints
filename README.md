My Portfolio: A Showcase of My Technical Projects.

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a tinkerer and a passionate enjoyer of all things Linux and open-source. This repository is a collection of my personal technical projects, where I experiment with new technologies and document my journey. I'm passionate about building things, and this space is a reflection of that.

## Other Projects

This section highlights some of my other projects, ranging from web applications to command-line tools. Each project has its own dedicated repository with a more detailed description.
### PebbleBoard: A Flutter-Based Bookmark Manager

*   **Description:** PebbleBoard is a versatile Flutter application designed to help you organize and manage your web content (bookmarks) efficiently. It allows you to create custom "boards" to categorize your links, complete with thumbnails and detailed metadata. Whether you're saving articles, videos, or any other web resource, PebbleBoard provides an intuitive interface to keep your digital life organized.
*   **Technologies Used:** Flutter.

### Thesus: Custom Ender 3 Pro

*   **Description:** This project is a heavily modified Ender 3 Pro 3D printer, which I've nicknamed "Thesus." I've re-engineered the hardware and software to improve its performance and reliability, turning it into a truly custom machine.
*   **Modifications:**
    *   **Structural:** Raised the printer's base to move the motherboard, power supply, and server below the print bed, creating a more compact and stable unit.
    *   **Hotend & Extruder:** Installed a custom hotend ([Mantis Dual 5015 Toolhead](https://www.printables.com/model/1163171-mantis-dual-5015-toolhead-for-ender-3cr10-with-tz)) and a 3D-printed extruder with a new stepper motor, configured as a direct drive using a custom bracket.
    *   **Leveling:** Integrated an Enderklack probe for precise bed leveling.
*   **Software & Technology:**
    *   The printer is powered by Klipper, a high-performance firmware, with Mainsail as the web interface for control and monitoring.
    *   I use GitHub to back up all my Klipper configuration files, ensuring my settings are always secure and version-controlled.
